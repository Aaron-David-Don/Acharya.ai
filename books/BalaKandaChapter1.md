## ॐ तपः स्वाध्यायनिरतं तपस्वी वाग्विदां वरम्। नारदं परिपप्रच्छ वाल्मीकिर्मुनिपुङ्गवम्॥

The ascetic Vālmīki asked Nārada, the best of sages and foremost of those conversant with words, ever engaged in austerities and Vedic studies.

## कोन्वस्मिन् साम्प्रतं लोके गुणवान् कश्च वीर्यवान्। धर्मज्ञश्च कृतज्ञश्च सत्यवाक्यो दृढत्नतः॥

Who at present in this world is crowned with qualities, and with prowess, knowing duty, and grateful, and truthful, and firm in vow?

Who is qualified by virtue of his character, and who is engaged in the welfare of all creatures? Who is learned and capable? Who alone is ever lovely to behold?

Who has subdued his heart, controlled his anger, is endowed with splendour, and devoid of malice? Whom do even the gods fear when enraged in battle?

Hearing Vālmīki's words, Nārada, cognizant of the three worlds, said with alacrity, “listen to me”!

Rare as are the qualities mentioned by you, I will, O sage, having duly considered, describe to you a person endowed with them.

In adherence to his father's promise, and for Kaikeyī's sake, the heroic Rāma departed to the forest.
